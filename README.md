# House Price Prediction
This repository provides a foundational notebook designed to introduce students to regression models using PyTorch Lightning. The example focuses on a regression problem, utilizing the Boston House Price dataset, which is presented in a CSV format and contains 13 features that are instrumental in predicting the selling price of a house. To maintain clarity and facilitate understanding for those new to machine learning, the model architecture consists of a single fully connected layer. While it is acknowledged that employing a neural network for such a straightforward regression task may not be the most practical approach in real-world scenarios, the primary goal of this exercise is to familiarize students with the PyTorch Lightning framework. This example serves as a stepping stone, allowing you to grasp the fundamental concepts of regression modeling while encouraging exploration and experimentation. As you work through the notebook, I invite you to think critically about the model's design and consider potential enhancements, thereby deepening your understanding of both regression techniques, the PyTorch Lightning library and Machine Learning in general.
